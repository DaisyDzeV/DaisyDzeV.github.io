    <h1>What are Hybrid Applications?</h1>
    <p class="mainp">Hybrid Applications are native applications written with web technologies. These websites have the look and feel of native apps but everything else is the companys website. They are built using HTML5 and Javascript. Hybrid apps load content on pages as users navigate through the app. Hybrid apps built in one source, easier to build, and can be released across platforms.

    <h3>React Native</h3>
    <p>React Native is..."Speaking of “almost” native technologies, our second alternative is of course React Native. React Native is the mobile cross-platform framework built by Facebook for its mobile application. This technology is based on ReactJS and is focused on performance and scalability above everything else."

 

On top of that, React Native provides an almost perfect native feel, which in the eyes of any user is a big plus. While PhoneGap and React Native are rather different, this doesn’t mean one can’t migrate from PhoneGap to the latter. And with the enormous community behind React Native, it is almost a certainty that there will be someone there to help with the process. </p>
