    <h1>What are Hybrid Applications?</h1>
    <p class="mainp">Hybrid Applications are native applications written with web technologies. These websites have the look and feel of native apps but everything else is the companys website. They are built using HTML5 and Javascript. Hybrid apps load content on pages as users navigate through the app. Hybrid apps built in one source, easier to build, and can be released across platforms. The pros of building Hybrid applications are that they consume less time to develop but the cons relate to perfomance issues.

    <h3>PhoneGap</h3>
    	<p>PhoneGap is an open source HTML5 platform that allows users to create native applications for several mobile operating systems. PhoneGap relies on HTML, CSS and Javacript user coded. So, it doesn't focus heavily on User Interface like other frameworks. It does however bridge between user code and native code with consistent and cross platform Javascript API. Some advantages are it's easy compatibility on many platforms and is cost-effective.  </p>

    <h3>Flutter</h3>
    	<p>Flutter is a Google UI toolkit used to build natively compiled apps for mobile, web, desktop, televisions, wearables and smart displays from a single code base.Users can quickly build high quality natively compiled apps for IOS and Android without writing seperate code for each app. Flutter mainly uses a reactive programming language called Dart. Flutter makes app development faster and easier. However, this might also be a disadvantage, compared to React Native, since most developers already are familiar with Javascript and the React Native library. Nevertheless, Flutter can skip interactive bridges with native components so it offers great user interfaces.   </p>

    <h3>React Native</h3>
    	<p>React Native is a mobile cross-platform framework mainly built by Facebook for its mobile application. This technology is based on ReactJS and it's main focus is performance and scalability. Most developers are familiar and use ReactJS library so it allows apps to be visually consistent in their UI elements. Developers can reuse codes and hot reload option. PhoneGap and React Native are different from eachother but it doesn't mean users can't migrate from PhoneGap to React Native. React Native is the best in performance and most cost effective compared to other frameworks like PhoneGap and Flutter.
